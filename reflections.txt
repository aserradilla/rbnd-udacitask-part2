# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
        Aproximately 4-5 hours.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
        When i was able to format everything included in app.rb
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
        I added multiple deletion. The user is able to delete the items he sees at first, then i convert that indexes
        into proper array indexes.
        A new type, "list", which represents a typical list of things to buy for example
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
        Synthesize my code more, i believe it is way too long.
